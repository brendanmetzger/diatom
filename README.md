# Diatom

*This template framework is a quick starting point. The `src/kernel.php` file aims to be everything necessary to begin making a website. There are additional classes to ensure that most goals can be met when it comes to authoring a content-based site.*


## Overview

This framework is primarily focused around creating reusable templates (HTML) and allowing them to be programmed elegantly by  avoiding parse errors (CDATA mishaps, unencoded entities, unclosed elements, etc.) that occur with non-validating templates or markdown libraries.

Guidance is offered when mistakes occur, ensuring that all output is entirely valid, queryable, and can undergo mutations, etc.

### Requirements

The bulk of authorship is __completely standard__ xHTML, CSS, JavaScript. Then to program things, use PHP and reference [php.net](http://php.net) for misc. documentation (there are no dependencies).

- Linux or Mac OS)
- php 7.4+ - `[brew](https://brew.sh/) install php`  to get that if needed
- Understanding of HTML and the Document Object Model

### Quickstart

1. [clone repo](https://github.com/brendanmetzger/diatom) (or within github, fork or "use template" )
2. run `bin/server` from the application root directory
3. Have at it




## Use Cases


###  Basic

Create new html files. Set processing instructions to deal with them. Append JS files wherever you want as script src='file.js', don't worry about lazy loading, domready or anything, it will just work. Same with CSS, just embed a style element or link wherever, and it will find its way to the right spot in the template. This is the coolest part of the intire thing.

*note* There is a JavaScript autoload framework that provides functionality for loading scripts (see views/js/autoload.js)--but it is specifically designed to never be interacted with, or have to remember any of it's methodology to use--simply write JS, and embed in a `<script>` by reference or embedded directly.

### Some Programming

Routing is done with callbacks. In `index.php` file, set routes to enhance basic templates, receive webhooks, generate custom templates, accept parameters.For more complicated methods, a controller can be specified as a callback. Some guidance on when/how to use controllers:

- A good design technique to employ; methods in a controller should be prepared share a base template (forms, listings, cards) and customize that as necessary.
- The anonymous class should inherit from the abstract `controller` class somewhere in the foodchain



### Lots more programming

Create models, work with a database, connect to APIs for Oauth, etc.

Almost any site could employ some feature of this framework methodology. At its very lightest, an application can be an easily editable boilerplate producer--incredibly convenient for sites that don't require user-generated content.. The next step up would be a framework that does employ some sort of database, but still has pretty standard layouts and several pages of bolerplate--this framework makes an excellent template preprocessor.

An API could be facilitated with the routing paradigm, or a receiver of webhooks.


## Templating

Templating is a powerful feature, and it stems from a premise that all content authored is a [Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model), and thus, can be sliced apart an queried. Any template can insert other documents, or parts of other documents as desired. Any markdown document is automatically parsed into a valid Document, and thus, adheres to the same principles.

- escaping: done by default
- conditions unnecessary: set datapoint to null (or undefined) to remove node
- yield, insert, and iterate components simpl
- tested: templates can only be html, so, pretty safe when it comes to injectionâ€”they will never be exposed to a programming language.
- author in markdown (slightly modified) or strict xHTML
- use [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to embed a variables (`${expression}`)
- embed scripts directly into the template; to lazy load, add `<?render behavior?>` to your document (see list below) [autoload-js]
- CSS, similar to javascript, can be written in a `<style>` element directly in any page or a stylesheet added with `<link/>`. 

### Caveats

#### variables cannot mix contexts:
`<li>${A} ${B}</li>` is Ok, A and B share the same context
`<li>${A} <span>${B}</span></li>` is **not** ok:  B is in an `Element` adjacent to a `Text` node (which contains A). The variable parser will ignore these conditions.  (TODO;  reconsider this, if it can be done elegantly)
`<li><span>${A}</span> <span>${B}</span></li>` is OK as both variables have a single nodetype (`Text`) as a context

### Renderers

- 
     - `<script src="path"></script>`  to `<script>Kit.script(path);</script>`
     - `<script>code</script>`  to `<script>Kit.script(data://uri,b64 code);</script>`
- **canonical** reorders the document to place (and organize) `<style>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`  into the `<head>` of the Document
- **sections** recursively looks for heading elements and builds sections around them.
- **editable** marks embedded Documents with their original source, and maps nodepaths fore editable nodes against that nodepath


:= Behavior
:: behavior finds all `<script>` elements and converts/encodes:
:: `<script src="path"></script>`  to `<script>Kit.script(path);</script>`
:: `<script>code</script>`  to `<script>Kit.script(data://uri,b64 code);</script>`
  

## Application



### Directory Layout

- **view/** contains template files, CSS, JavaScript, media--essentially the document root
  - **pages/** site-wide html 'pages', as well as the assumed layout is derived from the index.html file is stored in this directory by default
- html files are stored in a directory called pages

### Output Formats

The response type will honor the extension of the 'file' requested, and default to html if no extension is  provided. The differentitation between dynamic routes and actual file endpoints is invisible. Thus, `random.jpg` could be a file, a template, a route callback, or a controller and the server response would be pretty much the same.

- content-type is assumed return text/html (.html) if unspecified
- the extension determines the content-type (simply)
